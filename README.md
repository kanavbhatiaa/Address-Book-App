# Address-Book-App
This assignment is designed to take you through the process of creating basic classes and integrating them with a simple JavaFX generated interface.   Your group must create an Address Book program. The program should allow the user to add, edit and delete contacts.

A class ContactManager must be created that manages all of the Contact objects in the system. A single instance of the ContactManager class must be created for this application. The ContactManager object may be declared in the main JavaFX application class and instantiated in the init( ) method of the JavaFX application.
The program should also allow the user to perform the following three (3) auxiliary features:
•	View the full list of all contacts
•	Find and display a contact based on their first name and last name ( you must allow the user to enter the first and last name)
•	View all contacts that live in a particular City ( you must allow the user to enter a city to search for)
